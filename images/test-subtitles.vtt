00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.550
When I started Foliovision, my idea was that
I wanted to create a company that I would

2
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.660
like to work in, and also a company that I
would like to be a client of.

3
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.590
If you ask me how is Foliovision making the
world a better place or how are we making

4
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:33.680
the web work for you, I would say that we use
all the open source and open standards so

5
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.210
our products are not going to lock you inside
of some box, like, in past we moved hundreds

6
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.290
of websites out of restrictive content management
system into Wordpress, into open source world.

7
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.199
The secret is that we are doing things differently
here. Our clients aren’t just numbers

8
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.500
for us, because we are crafting something personal
for each of them.

9
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.640
And this really makes a difference.

10
00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.649
All of our clients have really great stories
and they all deserve to be told

11
00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.109
so it’s up to me to find a way to tell them online.

12
00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.789
We start by finding something special about the client

13
00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.389
and then we turn this special thing
into something that’s a part of every marketing campaign we do.

14
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.120
We are a small and strong group of like-minded young professionals

15
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.380
trying to achieve our company's goal, which is to make our clients happier

16
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.460
and to make their daily life easier.

17
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.657
Quick reactions are very important to our clients. That is why we make

18
00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.210
our services available at all times.

19
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.678
What making the web work for you means to
me is that whatever the level of technology

20
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.800
our clients come to us with, we will make
this sophisticated and ever-changing

21
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.499
internet technology accessible to them.

22
00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:00.059
The part of my job is training clients to
actually use their new websites,

23
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.980
so I'm not just creating the websites for them, I also
guide them through

24
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.680
what the website does and how it works.

25
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.660
We have a plugin tracking the number of post or website shares.

26
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.940
Several social media channels have recently limited the access

27
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.320
to this data so we had to adjust our plugin -

28
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.480
and we were one of the first ones to accomplish this.

29
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.780
With FV Player we are doing the cutting edge
work, we haven’t seen some of our features

30
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.250
in any other product, for example the way
we improved the embedding for Youtube and

31
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.750
Vimeo so that you can use all of our advanced
features - I think that it’s pretty unique.

32
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.750
Some of our clients actually like to be very
involved on the technology side, but many

33
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.150
of them, actually they’re just publishers,
people who know a lot about cakes, or they’re

34
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.170
people who know a lot about baseball, or soccer,
or Middle Eastern politics, but they don’t

35
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.690
know very much about how Internet technology
works. But for all of them we’re able to

36
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.100
make it possible for them to publish at the
highest possible level with all the same tools

37
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.040
that the sites like The New York Times, or
the Guardian

38
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.720
or any of these other huge sites enjoy.
